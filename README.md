#### Travel to Porto
The modern international Airport in Porto has connections to most European destinations.

To travel between Porto airport and the town you have 3 options:

One option is to use the Metro. Metro's airport station is located just in front of the arrivals zone. The metro station nearest the workshop venue is "Casa da Música", which is on the same line (violet line) as the airport. The journey time is 25 minutes, and there is a train every 30 minutes, from 6am to 1am. Its costs around 2 Euro. Note that the Metro works on an open system (no barriers that will open only upon presentation of a ticket) but controls are frequent. You need to be in possession of a validated ticket (tickets are validated before entering the train), otherwise you may be fined. For further details, see the Metro webpage;

Another option is to take a taxi. This is more expensive (25-30 Euro) and depending on the time of the day may in fact be slower than the Metro;

A third option is to use the door-to-door shuttle service from/to the airport that is offered by some hotels. You can find information about this option at the hotel's website.
